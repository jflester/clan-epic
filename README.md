<h1>Clan EPIC</h1>

<h4>About Us</h4>
We are a Destiny (made by Bungie) clan - Everyday Player In Combat [EPIC].
You can check us out at our page over on <a href="https://www.the100.io/groups/1412">the100.io</a>

<h4>The HTML</h4>
Currently this project is for version tracking of the HTML being used behind our the100 group page.
Eventually we hope to have our own Clan EPIC website so we can integrate more nicely with features from the Twitch and Bungie APIs.
